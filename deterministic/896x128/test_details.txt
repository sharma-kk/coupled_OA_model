The vel. coupling term is discretised implicitly while the temp. coupling term is discretised explicitly.
Solving the atm model before solving the ocean model. The models are solved separately. 
This algo. is very fast.

The simulation got stuck at t = 42.0. The KE data is stored till t = 42 and the .pvd files contains fields till t = 40.0

Therefore I wrote another script to continue the simulation from t=42.0 onwards.
